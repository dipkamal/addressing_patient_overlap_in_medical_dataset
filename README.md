# addressing_patient_overlap_in_medical_dataset

Patient overlap in medical data is a part of a more general problem in machine learning called **data leakage**. Patient overlap will create a biased model that will memorize the pattern of overlapped data. Hence, we must
ensure that there are no overlaps in training and validation set.
